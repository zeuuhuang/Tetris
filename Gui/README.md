1. Yes, it can because it is a subclass of Node, and any object that is a
Node can be added to the gridpane.
2. If the MoveDownWorker class is defined outside the GuiTetris class, the 
Guitetris would not be able to use methods in the MoveDownWorker because
GuiTetris is not a subclass of MoveDownWorker.
3. Implement the event handler to the GuiTetris and directly override method
in GuiTetris class.
